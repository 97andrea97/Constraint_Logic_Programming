    "CLP is not a programming language, but a programming paradigm, which is parametric with respect to the class (=kind) of constraints used in the language. Working with a particular CLP language means choosing a speciﬁc class of constraints (for example, ﬁnite domains, linear, or arithmetic) and a suitable constraint system (so also a particular constraint handlers) for that class. Let's see the more diffused:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- TREE DOMAIN: terms= variable values. The only constraints considered are equalities and disequalities between terms, like t1=t2. Equality constraints on terms can be simplified/ solved via unification. \n",
    "\n",
    "- REAL DOMAIN : terms = real expressions over variables and real constants. Each variable can only take a real number as a value.\n",
    "  Reals and function symbols can be combined, leading to terms that are expressions over reals and function symbols applied       to other terms.  In this case, variables ranges over real numbers and terms. (Equality of two terms can be simplified           using the rules for tree terms if none of the two terms is a real expression)\n",
    "      \n",
    "- FINITE DOMAIN: variables are constrained to take their value from a given, finite set. Choosing integers for values allows for arithmetic expressions as constraints. Constraint propagation proceeds by removing values from the sets of possible values that do not participate in any (partial) solution. (e.g X in 0..5. means X domain is [0,1,2,3,4,5]). THIS IS THE MOST POPULAR kind of language. Usually, the consistency check is based on some kind of constraint propagation, such as arc-consistency, some weaker version, like bound-consistency, or, more rarely, path-consistency. \n",

    "- They have a speciﬁc mechanism for deﬁning the initial ﬁnite domains of the variables: usually as an interval over the integers. For example, a typical CLP(FD) syntax to say that the domain of variable x contains all integers between 1 and 10 is X in [1..10], or X::[1,10]\n",
    "\n",
    "- A built-in predicate called \"LABELING\" (or \"label\", see them on swi prolog library) deﬁned over a list of variables, and which ﬁnds values for them such that all constraints in the current store are satisﬁed. The labeling predicate provides a mechanism to generate solutions, that is, variable assignments that satisfy all accumulated constraints. More precisely, this predicate triggers backtracking search over a set of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "EXAMPLE:\n",
    "p(X,Y,Z) :- [X,Y,Z] ins [1,10], X + Y = 9 - Z,label([X,Y,Z]).\n",
    "\n",
    "It deﬁnes a problem with three ﬁnite domain variables (x, y,z), each with domain containing the integers from 1 to 10, and sets a constraint over them (x+y =9−z). After this, it triggers backtracking search via predicate labeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Query:  :- p(X,Y,Z). Answer: ANY POSSIBLE INSTANTIATION of the three variables over their domains which satisﬁes the constraint x + y =9−x. \n",

    "Notice that without labeling, this same goal would return just the new domains obtained after applying constraint propagation :  [1..7].  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The clause above presents the typical shape of a CLP(FD) program: ﬁrst the variable domains are speciﬁed, then the constraints are imposed, and ﬁnally the backtracking search is invoked via a labeling predicate. A CLP(FD) program can consist of many clauses, but the overall structure of the program always reﬂects this order, which refers to a methodology called constrain and generate, where ﬁrst variables are constrained and only later (when the domains are smaller) backtracking search is invoked. This corresponds to applying constraint propagation prior to search and therefore avoiding early some dead-ends. \n",
